# community-management-simulator
An agent-based mode of an online community with management policies


WORK IN PROGRESS!

There are two versions of the model:

* v2 is the fully interactive version recommended for playing around with in NetLogo style
* v3 is intended for running from Behavior Space or in headless mode. The user interface is stripped to the barebones and the code is optimized for performance. 

Full model specification are found in the document inside the LATEX folder. There is also a PDF export for easier reading. 

Instructions and how-to information are found in the model itself in the Info tab.

To run the model, you will need NetLogo (https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml). Download the model from the NetLogo model folder, open it in NetLogo and run it from the interface tab as normal.
